Otherwise, it tries to find a _loader_ for the module.

To find a loader, `require` is guided by the `package.searchers` sequence. By
changing this sequence, we can change how `require` looks for a module. The
following explanation is based on the default configuration for
`package.searchers`.

First `require` queries `package.preload[modname]`. If it has a value, this
value (which must be a function) is the loader. Otherwise `require` searches
for a Lua loader using the path stored in `package.path`. If that also fails,
it searches for a C loader using the path stored in `package.cpath`. If that
also fails, it tries an _all-in-one_ loader (see `package.searchers`).

Once a loader is found, `require` calls the loader with two arguments:
`modname` and an extra value dependent on how it got the loader. (If the
loader came from a file, this extra value is the file name.) If the loader
returns any non-nil value, `require` assigns the returned value to
`package.loaded[modname]`. If the loader does not return a non-nil value and
has not assigned any value to `package.loaded[modname]`, then `require`
assigns **true** to this entry. In any case, `require` returns the final value
of `package.loaded[modname]`.

If there is any error loading or running the module, or if it cannot find any
loader for the module, then `require` raises an error.]]

`lua_CFunction` prototype (see `lua_CFunction`).

This is a low-level function. It completely bypasses the package and module
system. Unlike `require`, it does not perform any path searching and does not
automatically adds extensions. `libname` must be the complete file name of the

specified by `repl`, which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub`
also returns, as its second value, the total number of matches that occurred.
The name `gsub` comes from _Global SUBstitution_.

If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character
`%` works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `% _d_`,
with _d_ between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the _d_ -th captured
substring. The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The sequence `%%`
stands for a single `%`.

If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the
first capture as the key.

If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match
occurs, with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.

In any case, if the pattern specifies no captures, then it behaves as if the
whole pattern was inside a capture.

If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string
or a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is
**false** or **nil** , then there is no replacement (that is, the original
match is kept in the string).

Here are some examples:

    
    
         x = string.gsub("hello world", "(%w+)", "%1 %1")
         --> x="hello hello world world"
